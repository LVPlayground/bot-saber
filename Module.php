/**
 * LVPEchoHandler module for Nuwani v2
 *
 * This module is a rewrite of the basic functionality of my old IRC bot. The
 * bot monitored every single message in the LVP echo channel, parsed them and
 * extracted information from them. It worked quite well, however, as time
 * passed, more and more bugs came to the surface, which kept being fixed by
 * either work-arounds or disabling some functionality altogether by commenting
 * it out.
 *
 * I've been planning this rewrite for quite some time now, and decided it would
 * be best to make it as general as possible, so it can be plugged into any
 * Nuwani v2 bot and have general information about the LVP server handy at all
 * times, while anybody can make their own commands and functionality with it.
 *
 * Commands are implemented by using the LVPCommand class and registering them
 * to the LVPCommandHandler. The advantage of this is that the commands can be
 * executed from about anywhere, from IRC channels, as well as the crew chat in
 * the LVP gameserver.
 *
 * Other functionality includes keeping track of the LVP crew. A feed with all
 * the crew names in it is retrieved when the bot joins the LVP crew channel,
 * and will be able to determine the rights of a person ingame with that. Rights
 * on IRC are determined by what channel a command is executed in. A command
 * only for management will only be available in the management channels, but a
 * crew command will be available will also be available in crew channels.
 * Public commands are available in every LVP channel. Note that this "public"
 * is still limited to LVP channels only.
