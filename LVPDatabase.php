 * This class makes a connection to the LVP database on the webserver. I use
 * a separate class not just because I felt like it, but also because the main
 * database connection of the bot this class is running in is already taken by
 * another connection. Also, by providing my own database Singleton class,
 * extending it with some more redundancy, security or whatever buzzwords you
 * can think of, will be possible in the future without touching Nuwani's
 * source. I copied the base from Nuwani's Database class and modified it a bit
 * for some specific functionality.
